# Book Manager
This is a python program to search and organize books, created as part of a python course assignment.  

The user is prompted for a variety of actions for the program to perform, such as search for a book, move a book to a different shelf, and quit the program. A .txt file contains the details of the user's books, which is updated if the user moves a book and quits the program.
